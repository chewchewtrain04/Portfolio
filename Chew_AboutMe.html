        <p>My name is Zach. I am a freshman at Dublin High school. When I graduate from college I would like to be a Software Developer at Microsoft. My plans for reaching these goals are taking as many computer science related courses as I can to learn all about computer software and all the different languages to make myself flexible between using different languages applying for a job. This is my career choice because I like learning new things and wondering how all the software inside a computer works.</p>
        <p>I am a quick, reliable, patient, and a good team player. I like working on teams to complete anything because I think that it is better to work with people so you can learn from others, teach things to other people, and make new friends. My teamwork skills would be helpful on my career because when coding there will always be people that know something that you do not. Plus, learning, making, and fixing code together is a must when developing software because one person can not do it all by themselves.</p>
        <p>In high school I have not gotten any achievements yet. I am currently participating in the Dublin High Orchestra as my zero period class. From my experiences in Orchestra in Dublin High school, Fallon Middle school, and Creekside Middle school, I know that doing things as a team is way better than doing things by yourself. I am still too young to have any work experience but in the past I have volunteered for a few things. In 2015, I volunteered at a food bank to package a lot of food to send to the homeless shelters. In 2016, I volunteered to go to Walmart and buy toiletries and snacks for the homeless. In the future, I plan to work at a fast food or snack place. Overall I am a very energetic, kind, and curious person. If you have any questions about me or my website, please go to the conatact me page and fill out the google form!</p>
