        <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
        <h4>Class:Computer Science and Software Engineering</h4>
        <p>The objective of this Scratch project was to make a game or story for others to play in Computer Science and Software Engineering. We were given a set of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" alt="instructions">instructions</a> and a time limit from 8/29/17 to 9/7/17. The teacher let us do what we pleased afterwards. My teammate and I decided to remix one of our favorite classic games, Galaga. First, we found a game from a random person that seemed good but could improve upon and made a copy of it. Afterwards my partner and I took turns coding and doing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBF-rytKxvHFTIdT198LTmORzLErhfVBepkADklNCyM/edit">project notebook</a>. I learned a lot from this experience. I learned how to work well with others on coding, understand basic commands on scratch, and to be more open on expressing my ideas and opinions. One of the struggles we overcame was figuring out all of the code. The owner that coded this version of Galaga used a lot of different and complex blocks. In the end we found out how to manipulate the bugs in the game, the ship and its controls, and add a tutorial to the game. We were graded on this project using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit">rubric</a>.

        <h3>Image Manipulation Project</h3>
        <h4>Class: Computer Science and Software Engineering</h4>
        <p>The objective of this object was to create a photo editor that could fit the customer needs. We were given a set of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g919kguNczub1LxhojTfSCugJ-o8HiE33m9lY2A0l80/edit" alt="instructions">instructions</a> and about 2 weeks to complete this project. Our client was the family. The family wanted different shapes for borders and different colors for the borders. For this project, my partner and I decided that we wanted to do an ellipse border, a circle like border, and a regular border which could have the colors customized to your choosing. First we worked on the ellipse border and its color. We ended up choosing a teal colored border. We then moved on to the circle border. For that color we also chose teal. My partner tackled the regular frame by himself. He made the code so that you could enter in a color to the code and it would add a border of that color by expanding the image. Other than the last border, my partner and I always took turns coding and filling out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6QNZGYMVrFpebot_LybxgUNsc09YPBkk3moSwLXdkU/edit?usp=sharing">project notebook</a> . We were graded using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nm8KP_3KMR7Zcirw9ana57bFzw3gbN2HM_9K6iomzQs/edit">rubric</a>.
