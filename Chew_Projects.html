        <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
        <h4>Class:Computer Science and Software Engineering</h4>
        <p>The objective of this Scratch project was to make a game or story for others to play in Computer Science and Software Engineering. We were given a set of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" alt="instructions">instructions</a> and a time limit from 8/29/17 to 9/7/17. The teacher let us do what we pleased afterwards. My teammate and I decided to remix one of our favorite classic games, Galaga. First, we found a game from a random person that seemed good but could improve upon and made a copy of it. Afterwards my partner and I took turns coding and doing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBF-rytKxvHFTIdT198LTmORzLErhfVBepkADklNCyM/edit">project notebook</a>. I learned a lot from this experience. I learned how to work well with others on coding, understand basic commands on scratch, and to be more open on expressing my ideas and opinions. One of the struggles we overcame was figuring out all of the code. The owner that coded this version of Galaga used a lot of different and complex blocks. In the end we found out how to manipulate the bugs in the game, the ship and its controls, and add a tutorial to the game. We were graded on this project using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit">rubric</a>.
